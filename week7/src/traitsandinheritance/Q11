Q11

Use Sum Types when you have may types which share the same trait and there is no possibility for future sub types to be added. 
One advantage of sum types in Scala is that the compiler will enforce strict type checking to ensure all cases are handled.

Product types should be used when a single type is composed of more than one field.
