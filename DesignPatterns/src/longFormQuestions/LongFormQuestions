Question 2
a) The use of the keyword synchronized provides thread safety. Synchronized works by placing a monitor lock 
upon an object. This lock ensures that only one thread at a time can run the code enclosed within the 
synchronized block upon the locked object. In the LazySingleton implementation, the lock has been placed on 
the LazySingleton class object within the method getInstance(). This is because getInstance() is a static method.
Static methods belong to the class object rather than a specific instantion of that class. As only one class object
can exist, it ensures if thread t1 acquires the lock, it can instantiate the LazySingleton instance. Meanwhile, 
thread t2 will block until t1 releases the lock. When t2 acquires the lock, it will check if instance is null.
As t1 has already instantiated the object, t2 will process without instantiated it again. 

b) Although locks ensure thread safety, they do reduce performance. Using the LazySingleton example, when t1 
acquires the lock, t2 will block. Thread t2 will continue to block until t1 releases the lock. Therefore,
t2 will be performing no useful work during this time. 

c) I'm not sure what the question is here...

d) See LazySingleton getInstance method.
