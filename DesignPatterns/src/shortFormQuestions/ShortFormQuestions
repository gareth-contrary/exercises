Question 6 
Lazy Initialisation is a technique which can be used to conserve memory. When implementing the Singleton 
design pattern, there should only ever be one instance of the Singleton class. The Singleton class may be 
created as soon as the class is loaded instantiated the object in the field declaration. However, if 
memory management is important, this may consume valuable resources. Lazy Initialisation is used when this 
problem is a concern. In this technique, the Singleton object is created when it is first called on, preserving 
memory for the maximum amount of time.
